# Hey there!

I'm [vcokltfre](https://vcokltf.re), a software developer and infrastructure nerd who makes lots of things in Python. I usually make Discord bots using libraries like [disnake](https://github.com/disnakedev/disnake) and [nextcord](https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord). I also develop libraries of my own sometimes, like [corded](https://github.com/vcokltfre/corded). If I'm not making Discord bot's I'm likely handling infrastructure and moderation for a few Discord servers, or creating APIs in FastAPI. I also like to write technical articles and tutorials, keep an eye out for more of those coming soon!

## Languages I use

(In order of proficiency)

- Python (with nextcord/disnake, asyncpg, ormar, asyncio)
- Golang (Echo, Gorm)
- TypeScript/JavaScript (with CF workers, Svelte)
- C#
- Rust
- Elixir
